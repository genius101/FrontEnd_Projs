Hello Viewer <br>
This is a Project to show the effect of Media Query for a responsive website. <br>
Above 800px, we would have a full display most especially the two images on the right would display side by side. <br>
Between 600px-800px which is assumed to be a tablet size, the two images by the right would colapse into a block format. <br>
Below 600px, which is assumed to be a mobile format. The right side with Header "TITLE HEADING", would colapse under the "About Me" Section. <br>

Thank you for viewing <br>
